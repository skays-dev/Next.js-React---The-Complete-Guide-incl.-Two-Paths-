## Modules

What is NextJS? And why would you use it?

Why is just React (in many cases) not enough?

Creating NextJS projects from the ground up & understanding these projects

Working with file-based routing

Adding dynamic routes and catch-all routes

Implementing different forms of page pre-rendering and server-side rendering

Working with data and adding data fetching + pre-fetching to your apps

Pre-generating dynamic and static pages

Adding optimizations like metadata to pages

Optimizing images with the NextJS Image component

Building fullstack apps with API routes

Managing app-wide state with React context (in NextJS apps)

Adding authentication to NextJS apps

Multiple complete apps where we'll apply all these core concepts!

A complete React.js refresher module (so that we're all on the same page)

A NextJS summary module so that you can refresh what you learned or just explore the core features quickly

And much more!
